### React Calculator

An example React application project for the FreeCodeCamp Frontend Libraries certification.

The calculator takes number input by the GUI with mouse clicks or via
the keyboard by the respective buttons. Operations are carried out
following the rule of Immediate Execution Logic.

##### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `ESC` =  clear the input
- `ENTER` = calculate the result

[//]: # (- `BACKSPACE` = delete last input)

Inspired by [this project](https://javascript-calculator.freecodecamp.rocks/).
